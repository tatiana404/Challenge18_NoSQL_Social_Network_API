# NoSQL Challenge: Social Network API

The challenge is to create an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. I havde used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.jsLinks to an external site. and MongooseLinks to an external site. packages
